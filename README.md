CS 1501 Algorithm Implementation

Instructor: Nicholas Farnan

## Course Description:
Algorithms are solutions to problems that are well-suited to being implemented by a programmer and run by computers. A large part of a computer scientist's job is solving problems. In this course, we will explore common computer science problems, solutions to those problems, and the tradeoffs of the various solutions. Towards the end of the course, we will explore what makes an algorithm "good" and how to determine the quality of an algorithm.
